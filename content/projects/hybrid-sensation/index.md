Hybrid Sensation takes place both in The Royal Danish Theatre's blackbox and in a virtual parallel world, which the audience becomes a part of as soon as they are equipped with VR headsets. During the performance, a puppet-like host, played by Iza Mortag Freund, invites the audience to interact with the shared meta-reality. Together, everyone becomes part of a mixed reality ceremony.

Hybrid Sensation is an exploration of the potential for the inclusion of various forms of augmented reality technology within the performing arts. The experience is a step on the way to comprehensive data processing and sensory-based digitization in the performing arts field.

## My Role
My role required a deep understanding of creative and technical aspects of mixed reality experiences. My contributions in sound directions, technical problem-solving, and collaboration with the composer played a crucial role in bringing the project to life.

### Technical Problem-Solving:
Assisting in resolving technical issues related to OSC (Open Sound Control) communication between computers, ensuring data exchange for the experience.
Troubleshooting technical issues with VR headset settings. Enabling developer settings to extend the headset's uptime. Resolving tracking issues to ensure a seamless VR experience. Setting up infrared lights in the space to enhance tracking accuracy.


### Sound Direction and Mixing:

Collaborating with the composer to settle and direct the sounds for the mixed reality experience.
Assisting in the mixing and mastering of the sounds in a quadrophonic speaker setup.
