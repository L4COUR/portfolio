You are a Soul, a creature from a mystical kin, who spend their life awaiting the Trial of the Mountain. As you are flung out of the sky into a magical world, you know, that your time has come.

Fight your way through the Mountain's inner caves and defeat envious Maskless to overcome the trial. Arrive at the summit and defeat the Mountain's final challenge, in order to earn our right to ascension.
