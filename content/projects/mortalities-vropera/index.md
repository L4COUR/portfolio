I designed and implemented sound effects using Wwise and Unity. Worked closely together with SØS Gunver Ryberg in implementing her compositions through a combination of ambisonics and object-based audio within Wwise middleware.

Four guests are let in at a time for this exclusive experience which is both physical and virtual. After an entering ritual you physically walk around in a big live installation where a multisensorial death opera is taking place.

Inspired by necroaesthetic aspects of death, the artistic team has developed six versions of death which you get to try. You travel through the cold, the heavy, the dirty, the distorted and get close to the full decomposition – before life rises from the ashes again.
