<br></br>
I am a sound designer and composer based in Copenhagen, specializing in sonic interaction and audio hardware design since 2016. I hold a master's degree in audiodesign from Aarhus University.

In my practice I am interested in __how we interact with sound making systems__, whether it be designing tools that enables sound designers to create more expressive sounds, art installations with interactive components that encourages audience exploration or games in which the sound dynamically responds to players actions.

In recent years I have worked on various projects including; transforming an [art installation to an expressive instrument]({{< ref "/projects/plant-sensorium-liveset" >}} "Live set with 12 plants") and developing a [wearable instrument]({{< ref "/projects/prototype-enchanted-amplifier" >}} "enchanted-amp") for a live performance at the Royal Danish Theater.

_"...you solve the obstacles that occur so quickly and have such a good systematic approach and overview of the project! It has been essential during this process. Not least, your patience, calmness, and humor have helped so much."_

## Get in touch!
Connect with me to discuss your project. I provide a variety of services including; __consulting__ on sound and interactive technologies for your project, __sound design__ and __implementation__ for your game or installation. Additionally I offer __workshops__ or __private lessons__ on Max/MSP and Ableton Live from beginner to advanced level.

__Sharing knowledge__ is big part of my practice. I have conducted numerous [workshops]({{< ref "/workshops" >}} "workshops") on digital sound programming with Max/MSP, integration of audio on embedded linux platforms with BELA and composition techniques with Ableton Live and Live Coding, just to name a few. I have taught at various levels ranging from pupils at Engelsholm folk highschool to bachelor and master students at Aarhus University. I think it is important to create an environment where students are empowered to explore unique pathways within sound and technology. Through sharing my knowledge and passion, I'm continually inspired by the diverse insights that emerge from these collaborative learning experiences.
